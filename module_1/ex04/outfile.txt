Create a program that takes three parameters in the following order: a AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHname and
two strings, s1 and s2.
It will open the AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH <AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHname> and copies its content into a new AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHname>.replace, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
Using C AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH manipulation functions is forbidden and will be considered cheating. All
the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace. Use them
wisely!
Of course, handle unexpected inputs and errors. You have to create and turn in your
own tests to ensure your program works as expected.
